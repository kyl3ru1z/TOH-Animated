# TOH-Animation
Created Towers Of Hanoi using animations. Towers of Hanoi consist of three towers and disks placed one over the other. The objective of this game is to move the stack from the first tower to the third tower. When moving the disk to another tower the user has to follow two simple rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time and no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. This iteration works simmilarly to the buttons version, but this time the discs pan across the screen with an animation.
